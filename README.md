EFFECTIVE:

1. TEMPERATURE:

   - CAUSES: 1. Emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 2. Decreasing reflective surfaces of the Earth (glaciars)
   - EFFECTS: 1. Severe storms as more moisture evaporate which exacerbastes rainfall and flooding. 2. Wildfires ignition and propagation. 3. Warming and rising of oceans.

   - WHAT YOU CAN DO: 1. Plant trees wherever you can. Community gardens and green roofs can help cool urban heat islands. 2. Switch to greener energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels. 3. Think green before you buy. Consider a productâ€™s durability, sustainability, and ease of recycling when making a purchase.

2. CARBON DIOXIDE:

   - CAUSES:

     - Construction and manufacturing industry to build real estate and produce iron, plastics, clothes, and others.
     - Food production. Deforestation and land clearing for agriculture and grazing. Livestock digestion.
     - Cutting down forests: as trees are cut they release the carbon they have been storing. Less trees also less carbon dioxide absortion that ends up in the atmosphere.
     - Transportation as they mostly run on fossil fuels.

   - EFFECTS:

     - Health threat from air pollution.
     - It contributes to thicken the layer of gases that blankets the Earth and trap the sun's heat.

   - WHAT YOU CAN DO:
     - Consume energy from clean sources like airwind turbines and solar panels.
     - Reduce consumption of transport, clothing, electronics, heating and cooling.
     - Reduce food waste.

3. NITROUS OXIDE:

   - CAUSES:

     - Generating power by burning fossil fuels.
     - Agriculture, especially fertilized soil and animal manure.
     - Melting of permafrost that contains ancient soil, sediments, and organic matter of plants and animals that, when exposed to oxygen, release nitrous oxide.

   - EFFECTS:

     - depletes the ozone layer.

   - WHAT YOU CAN DO:
     - Consume energy from clean sources like airwind turbines and solar panels.
     - Reduce consumption of transport, clothing, electronics, plastics.
     - Reduce food waste.

   4. METHANE

   - CAUSES:

     - Gasoline for cars and coal for heating a building.
     - Organic waste from livestock and garbage landfills release great amounts of methane during decomposition.

   - EFFECTS:

     - Air pollution which contributes to premature deaths.
     - Damage to crops such as soy, wheat, rice and maize.

   - WHAT YOU CAN DO:
     - Reduce food waste so less methane will be produced in landfills.
     - Invest in technologies for efficient management of cooling/heating in buildings.
     - Use greener transportation like biking, walking, carpooling.

   5. POLAR ICE

      - CAUSES:

        - Rise in temperature

      - EFFECTS:

        - Less reflective surfaces which leads to increasing heat waves.
        - Rising of sea level
        - Loss of artic wildlife and ecosystem.

      - WHAT YOU CAN DO:
      - Adopt any necessary measures to reduce emissions and, hence, global warming
      - Help communities and wildlife adapt to changes already underway.

TEMPERATURE:

- effects: 3. Melting of the Artics 3. Severe storms as more moisture evaporate which exacerbastes rainfall and flooding. 4. Increased drought as water becomes scarcer. It threatens entire ecosystems. 6. Loss of species by forest fires, extreme weather, invasive pests. Some will be able to relocate, others won't

METHANE: causese: Production and transportation of coal, natural gas, and oil. 1. producing food.

What you can do: 1. Renewable energy 2. Promote jobs and companies that put the well-being at the heart of the transition to a green economy. 4. More energy-efficient appliances. 5. shift forms of transport to zero emissions. 6.

NITROUS OXIDE:

YOU CAN DO: ENERGY: 2. energy efficient appliances.
WASTE: 2. 3. Reuse or repurpose itiems such as old clothing, cloth grocery bagas, and containers. 4. Buy used items and donate you used ones to reduce production
TRANSPORTATION: 1. 2 Energy efficient vehicle with higher miles per gallon. 3. Switch for electricle if you can. 4. Fewer trips like grouping errands and teleworking if available.
WATER: It takes energy to pump, treat and heat water so lower consumption reduces greenhouse emissions. 1. Use water efficiently at home. Run clothes washer at full load and cold water and use dishwasher. 2. Check for water leaks. 3. Take shorter showers.
