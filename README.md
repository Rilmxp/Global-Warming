EFFECTIVE:

1. TEMPERATURE:

   - CAUSES: 1. Emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. 2. Decreasing reflective surfaces of the Earth (glaciars)
   - EFFECTS: 1. Greenhouse gases blanket the Earth and trap the sun's heat. 2. Wildfires ignition and propagation. 3. Warming and rising of oceans.

   - WHAT YOU CAN DO: 1. Plant trees wherever you can. Community gardens and green roofs can help cool urban heat islands. 2. Switch to greener energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels. 3. Think green before you buy. Consider a productâ€™s durability, sustainability, and ease of recycling when making a purchase.

TEMPERATURE:

- effects: 3. Melting of the Artics 3. Severe storms as more moisture evaporate which exacerbastes rainfall and flooding. 4. Increased drought as water becomes scarcer. It threatens entire ecosystems. 6. Loss of species by forest fires, extreme weather, invasive pests. Some will be able to relocate, others won't

CARBON DIOXIDE: - Causes: 1. Generating power by burning fossil fuels
2.Manufacturing industry to produce iron, plastics, clothes, and others. Construction industry's machines that run on fossil fuels. Manufacturing is one the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Cutting down forests: as trees are cut they release the carbon they have been storing. Less trees also less carbon dioxide absortion that ends up in the atmosphere. 3. Transportation as they mostly run on fossil fuels.

3. Producing food: deforestation and clearing land for agriculture and grazing. Livestock digestion.

4. Powering buildings: mainly energy for heating and cooling that depend on coal, oil and natural gas.

5. Consuming too much, from transport, to clothing, electronics plastics and food waste.

Effects: - Health threat from ari pollution.

- Can Do: 1. produce energy from clean sources like airwind turbines and solar panels.

NITROUS DIOXIDE: - Causes: 1. Generating power by burning fossil fuels.
2.Manufacturing industry to produce iron, plastics, clothes, and others. Construction industry's machines that run on fossil fuels. Manufacturing is one the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions.

- Can Do: 1. produce energy from clean sources like airwind turbines and solar panels.

METHANE: causese: 1. producing food. 2. Gasoline for cards 3 coal for heating a building. 4. Landfills for garbage. production and transportation of coal, natural gas, and oil. 5. originate from the decay of organic waste from livestock and other agricultural activities and municipal solid waste landfills

What you can do: 1. Renewable energy 2. Promote jobs and companies that put the well-being at the heart of the transition to a green economy. 3. Tecnologies fro keeping cool/heat in buildings. 4. More energy-efficient appliances. 5. shift forms of transport to zero emissions. 6.

NITROUS OXIDE: 1. Source of nitrous oxide is agriculture, especially fertilized soil and animal manure. 2. permafrost begins to melt, and ancient soil, sediments, and organic matter of plants and animals ancient materials are also exposed oxygen which releases nitrous oxide.
Effects: 1. depletes the ozone layer.

YOU CAN DO: ENERGY: 1. Heat and cool your home smartly, 2. energy efficient appliances.
WASTE: 2. Reduce food waste: so less methane will be produced in landfills. 3. Reuse or repurpose itiems such as old clothing, cloth grocery bagas, and containers. 4. Buy used items and donate you used ones to reduce production
TRANSPORTATION: 1. Use greener transportation like biking, walking, carpooling. 2 Energy efficient vehicle with higher miles per gallon. 3. Switch for electricle if you can. 4. Fewer trips like grouping errands and teleworking if available.
WATER: It takes energy to pump, treat and heat water so lower consumption reduces greenhouse emissions. 1. Use water efficiently at home. Run clothes washer at full load and cold water and use dishwasher. 2. Check for water leaks. 3. Take shorter showers.
